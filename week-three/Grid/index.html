        <li>One <strong>Look Ma, No Media Queries! Responsive Layouts Using CSS Grid.</strong>’s easier than what you may think, and since CSS Grid was built with responsiveness in mind, it’ll take less code than writing media queries all over the place.Grid Layout.The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

A lot of stuff is going on in that single property, so let’s go one step at a time.</li>
        <li>six he grid setup
        The grid is created using our familiar display: grid; property, where columns are defined using repeat(), auto-fit and minmax(). We also added a bunch rows with a repeat() function and defined a gap to our images, using grid-gap. But the new player here is the grid-auto-flow:</li>
